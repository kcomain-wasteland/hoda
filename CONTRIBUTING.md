Exciting!?

## Translating docs
Please **DO NOT** do any translations until this package reaches v1.0.0.

## Why Python 3.11? Why not 3.8 or 3.10?
I would definitely support 3.8 (and I did support it before ...when there was barely any code) but the new
stuff in py3.11 makes my life **significantly** better while developing this. In the future, I may consider porting
back to older versions of python. For the time being, you'd have to stick with 3.11.
